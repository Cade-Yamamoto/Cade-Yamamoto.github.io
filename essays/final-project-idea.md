<h1> Project: ICSpace Revamp </h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<i>The problem</i>: The current ICSpace page is outdated, unused, and not user friendly. There is no clean way to navigate around the site and no community oriented pages.<br>
<i>The solution</i>: The new ICSpace page will allow for a user friendly experience for club leaders or general users to know whats going on around ICSpace with scheduling and more readily availible information. 

<h2>Mockup Page Ideas</h2>
Landing Home Page, User Home Page, User Profile Page, Admin Home Page, General Schedule Page, Schedule Request Page, Admin Schedule Page, General Information, Club Information, ICS Help Page

<h2>Use Case Ideas</h2>
-New user goes to landing home page, logs in, gets user home page, sets up profile <br>
-Admin goes to landing home page, logs in, gets Admin home page, allowed to edit site and accept schedule changes or other requests <br>
-User goes to landing home page, logs in, gets user home page , They can read recent events the go to the schedule page, They can request a time in the schedule for their activity and need to wait for an admin to accept it.

<h2>Beyond the Basics</h2>
The users can "Join" clubs and appear in those club pages. Users can submit their own information to create a personal profile. Users can indiviually request help or schedule times.
