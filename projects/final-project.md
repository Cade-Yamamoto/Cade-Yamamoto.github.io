For my final 314 project, my team and I developed a web application called Jiffy Jobs. The purpose of the website is to help connect students and companies at UH Manoa. The website allows users to create an account as a student or company, edit their profile, and have their company/student profile listed on a dashboard. Companies and students can also rate each other based on internship/job experience.

The Jiffy Jobs project was an opportunity for me to experience working in a team development environment with tasks being completed using issue driven management. Issues were divided among group members based on their strengths and our team met frequently to complete tasks as a team. Our project also followed a coding standard to avoid confusion when merging and editing code.

Although the project did not include all of the features we hoped to have due to the limited timeframe, the Jiffy Jobs project was a valuable experience that strengthened my web design and team development skills.
