Kali Linux is an open source debian-based Linux distro that was designed for penetration testing and digital forensics. Kali Linux comes pre-installed with many tools used to test the strength of security systems.

Throughout my senior year of high school, I learned how to effectively and ethically use the tools provided in Kali to test security systems and strengthen the security of my home network. After the competitive season of Cyber Patriot, I had the opportunity to test Kali Linux tools on a closed network within the school.

My experience with Kali Linux taught me about cyber ethics, as well as how to strengthen systems using offensive security. I was also able to learn to process of hacking as well as hacking strategies that can be used to fully test the effectiveness of security systems.
